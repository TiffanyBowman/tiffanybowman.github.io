        		<h1>Welcome to my kewl ace Webpage!</h1>
				<p>Hello, I’m Tiffany Bowman and welcome to my website! I was raised in Kapolei on the island of Oahu, and later moved to Ewa Beach. To get things started, I was born on March 24, 2004. Idk my ethnicities that well… :/ During my free time I like to golf, and in a month I will be starting my OIA season. My goal is to make it to states, and hopefully be in the top 3. I am a 3.8 GPA student, and currently a sophomore that plays for the Campbell Golf Team. I’m also in ROTC, and show leadership skills by moving up in a staff position. After I graduate High school, I plan on going to college and later joining the Air Guard. I want to become a F-22 pilot, and a commercial airlines pilot for Hawaiian. I travel almost twice a year, and next I'm planning on going to Japan. <em> :p </p>
