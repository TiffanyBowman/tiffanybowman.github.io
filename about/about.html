    <h3 style="color: white; padding-bottom:20px; padding-top:10px;">My name is Tiffany Bowman, and I am currently a sophomore at James Campbell High School, located in Ewa Beach, HI. I was born and raised in Kapolei, Hawaii and I have three siblings. Two older sisters, and a younger brother. I have many different ethnicities, ones that I know of are Hawaiian, British, irish, and German.<br> Some of my hobbies are golfing, sleeping, and listening to spotify. Sadly, I am NOT into archery:(.  The best part about my vacations are traveling! I have been all over the U.S. but my favorite trip was taking a cruise to Alaska, and Vancouver Island(located in Canadia).<br>In the future, I want to become a fighter pilot and fly the f-22's that are part of the Hawaii Air National Guard. To become a pilot like that, I will have to get a four year degree, so i'm going to go to school at Manoa. I'm deciding to get a degree in dermatology, engineering, or computer science. So far, i'm really liking this AP Computer Science class. I still have four years to decide my degree, but i'm going to lean more toward the technology field. Besides that, my mother works for the Marriot, and my father is a mechanic for Honda. My parents wanted me to choose this class over engineering, and i'm glad they did!</h3>
